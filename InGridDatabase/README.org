* InGrid database tool
This is a tool to build and read from a database, which stores
information about different InGrids.

** Compilation
In order to compile the main =databaseTool=, just run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nimble koch
#+END_SRC
from this folder.
This will create the =databaseTool= in the =src= directory.

** Usage
In order to add a chip to the InGrid database, you need to provide a
director, which follows a certain structure and call the
=databaseTool= as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./databaseTool --add=<path-to-folder>
#+END_SRC
where the directory needs to look as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

#+END_SRC
The name of the directory does not matter. Important however, is the
content of the =chipInfo.txt=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chipName: E4 W66
test: This is a test note!
board: SeptemH
chipNumber: 2
Another test comment!
#+END_SRC
The fields =chipName= and =chipNumber= are required. All others (as
many as desired) will be read as =(key, value)= pairs and added to the database.
