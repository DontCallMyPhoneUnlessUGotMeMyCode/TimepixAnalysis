* Cut parameters
This file contains the cut parameters described in C. Krieger's PhD
thesis.
Appendix B are the cuts applied to the raw CDL runs to get rid of
unphysical events like double hits. Appendix C are the cuts applied to
the spectra to create the actual reference spectra by cutting on the
main line.

* CDL 2019 cuts

The cuts for the creation of the X-ray reference datasets are found in
[[file:~/CastData/ExternCode/TimepixAnalysis/Analysis/ingrid/private/cdl_cuts.nim]]
in the 
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
func getEnergyBinMinMaxVals2018*(): Table[string, Cuts]
#+END_SRC
proc. 

The length, and RMS cuts remain the same. Only the charge cuts change
to actually fit to the charge values from our Run-2 and Run-3
Septemboard detector.

*NOTE*: The cut values presented below are those used for all plots in
Hendrik's MSc thesis as well as for the SPSC Sep 2019 report.
However, due to the bug in 
https://github.com/Vindaar/TimepixAnalysis/commit/64da2bef2bf6e8a29451ec774dd697120362c864
these values are actually wrong and will have to be changed.

The charge cut values are derived from the fits to the main peaks in the spectra.
It's
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let minCharge = gmu - 3 * gs
let maxCharge = gmu + 3 * gs
#+END_SRC
to cover 99.7 % of the spectrum.

** TODO Update the above values using correct total charge calc

Need to run through all spectra fits again to derive fit parameters
and calculate those charge cuts again from the mean and sigma of the
main peaks.
