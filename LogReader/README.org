* Notes on log file location

In the past the CAST log files were found in the following locations:

-  =AngleEncoders= and =logfiles= (slow control)
  #+begin_src sh
  /afs/cern.ch/exp/cast/sc/
  #+end_src
  Now that =afs= doesn't exist anymore, the same is found on =eos= in:
  #+begin_src sh
  /eos/experiment/cast/sc
  #+end_src

  Note: there is a =tracking-log= directory in the above path, but it
  only contains very old logs. See below.
- =tracking-log=:
  #+begin_src sh
  /afs/cern.ch/exp/cast/vhscratch/SlowControl/tracking-log
  #+end_src
  and nowadays:
  #+begin_src sh
  /eos/experiment/cast/vhscratch/SlowControl/tracking-log
  #+end_src
